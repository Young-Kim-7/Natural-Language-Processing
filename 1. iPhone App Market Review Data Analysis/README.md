1.Executive Summary
Apple’s iPhone revenue in India rose 42% year over year and is expected to continue the growth as the middle class demographic s in India are increasing their “appetite for premium devices” ( Kaustubh,2024 )). As Apple’s fifth largest smartphone market, the Indian market is significant strategic importance to the company. To take advantage of this opportunity, our project utilize d Indian consumer reviews on Flipkart, the b iggest Indian e commerce platform, to conduct Sentiment Analysis and Topic Identification. By analyzing sentiments with the VADER Lexicon and topics through Latent Dirichlet Allocation, we identified key features that impacted user satisfaction and gained direction and guidance for product improvement. Despite predominantly positive sentiment our analysis revealed disparities, particularly concerning battery features of the smartphone, suggesting areas for improvement. We recommend marketing the product based on phone performance, camera quality, and value for money, while addressing negative sentiments on battery performance to better meet customer’s expectations and improve overall satisfaction.
